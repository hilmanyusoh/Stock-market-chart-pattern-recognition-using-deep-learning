## Research Projects: Stock Chart and Wyckoff Pattern Recognition Using Artificial Intelligence (AI/Deep Learning)

This set of projects aims to revolutionize technical analysis in the stock market by leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning** to transform subjective chart interpretation into a fast, unbiased, quantitative analysis system[cite: 58, 236].
